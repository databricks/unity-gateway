"""`ucode export`: serialize the workspace's managed coding-agent config to portable JSON.

Reads the local managed config (the one file :mod:`ucode.managed_config` owns, populated when a
launch refreshes it from the workspace), validates and serializes it to the external proto-JSON
``CodingAgentConfig`` (prefixed with the source ``workspace`` and a ``spec_version`` envelope) to
stdout or a file.

Deliberately read-only and offline: no auth, no admin check, no discovery, no publish, and no write
except the explicitly requested ``--file`` output. That makes it role-agnostic (any developer can
run it) and keeps the machine-readable stream on stdout uncontaminated by Rich output.
