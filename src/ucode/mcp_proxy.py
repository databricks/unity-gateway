"""`ucode mcp-proxy`: a stdio MCP server that bridges to a Databricks
streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint, injecting a freshly-minted OAuth bearer.

Every coding agent ucode configures points its Databricks MCP servers at this
one command (``ucode mcp-proxy --url <endpoint> --profile <profile>``) as a
local **stdio** server. The agent spawns and reaps the proxy as a child process
— ucode owns no long-lived process and no background refresh thread. The proxy
speaks stdio to the agent and streamable-HTTP to Databricks, and mints a fresh
token from the Databricks CLI profile on **every** upstream HTTP request via an
httpx ``Auth`` hook, so the bearer never goes stale mid-session.

This replaces the previous per-client header auth (static ``Bearer
${OAUTH_TOKEN}``, Claude ``headersHelper``, Cursor literal-token rewrites): one
uniform mechanism, token refresh in a single place, and the proxy is an
invisible implementation detail baked into each client's config.

MCP SDK compatibility (1.x and 2.x). The proxy uses the SDK's *2.x-native* call
shape — ``streamable_http_client(url, http_client=<AsyncClient>)`` — which both
mcp 1.28+ and mcp 2.x export (1.x's older ``streamablehttp_client`` is a thin
deprecated shim over it). The only thing that differs across the major versions
is the HTTP library: mcp 1.x builds on ``httpx``, mcp 2.x on ``httpx2``. We
resolve whichever the installed SDK uses (see ``_httpx``) and build the client
and auth from that, so a single code path works against both — no version cap.

Auth failures are terminal and are reported *fast*. When the Databricks CLI
can't mint a token (expired refresh token, logged-out profile), the proxy prints
the CLI's own message to stderr and exits ``AUTH_FAILURE_EXIT_CODE`` rather than
letting the client wait out its MCP startup timeout. Every server registered
against the same profile fails at once in that state, so a silent hang is
especially confusing -- the user needs to be told to re-run
``databricks auth login``.
